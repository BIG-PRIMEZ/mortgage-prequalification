# Manual Multi-Client Testing Guide

This guide helps you manually verify that the application properly isolates data between multiple concurrent users.

## Prerequisites

1. Backend server running (`npm run start:dev`)
2. Frontend running (`npm run dev` in frontend directory)
3. Multiple browser windows/tabs or different browsers

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Isolation Test

**Goal**: Verify that two users can have separate conversations simultaneously.

**Steps**:

1. **Browser 1 (User A)**:
   - Open the application
   - Start a conversation: "I want to purchase"
   - Enter income: "$75,000"
   - Enter monthly debts: "$500"

2. **Browser 2 (User B)**:
   - Open the application in a different browser or incognito window
   - Start a conversation: "I want to refinance"
   - Enter income: "$120,000"
   - Enter monthly debts: "$1,200"

3. **Verification**:
   - ‚úì User A should only see purchase-related questions
   - ‚úì User B should only see refinance-related questions
   - ‚úì Neither user should see the other's data
   - ‚úì Check browser console for session IDs - they should be different

### Scenario 2: Verification Code Isolation

**Goal**: Ensure verification codes don't leak between users.

**Steps**:

1. **Both Users**: Complete data entry up to verification
2. **User A**: Enter phone number ending in "1234"
3. **User B**: Enter phone number ending in "5678"
4. **Check server logs**: Each user should receive different verification codes
5. **Try cross-verification**: User A's code should NOT work for User B

### Scenario 3: Results Isolation

**Goal**: Verify calculation results are user-specific.

**Steps**:

1. **User A**: 
   - Income: $75,000, Debts: $500
   - Purchase price: $300,000, Down payment: $60,000

2. **User B**:
   - Income: $120,000, Debts: $1,200
   - Property value: $450,000, Loan amount: $350,000

3. **Verification**:
   - Each user should see different borrowing capacities
   - Results should match their specific inputs

### Scenario 4: Session Persistence

**Goal**: Verify sessions persist across page refreshes.

**Steps**:

1. Start a conversation and enter some data
2. Refresh the page
3. Continue the conversation
4. ‚úì The conversation should continue from where you left off
5. ‚úì Previously entered data should be remembered

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Message Test

**Goal**: Test rapid concurrent messaging.

**Steps**:

1. Open 3+ browser windows
2. Start conversations in all windows simultaneously
3. Type messages rapidly in all windows
4. ‚úì Each conversation should remain separate
5. ‚úì No messages should appear in wrong windows

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Each user has a unique session ID
- Conversations don't mix
- Data remains isolated
- Verification codes are user-specific
- Results match individual inputs

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- Seeing another user's name/email/phone
- Receiving messages meant for another user
- Verification codes working across users
- Results showing wrong calculations
- Session data mixing after refresh

## Checking Logs

Monitor the backend logs for:

```bash
# Session creation
üìç Express Session ID: sess_1234567_abc123

# WebSocket connections
Client sess_1234567_abc123 connected with session sess_1234567_abc123

# Message routing
Message sent to 1 client(s) for session sess_1234567_abc123

# Verification isolation
üíæ Stored code in session for phone: 4155551234
```

## Browser Developer Tools

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Check `mortgage-session-id` - should be unique per user
4. Network tab ‚Üí WS ‚Üí Check WebSocket messages
5. Console ‚Üí Look for session-related logs

## Common Issues to Test

1. **Cookie Blocking**: Test with third-party cookies blocked
2. **Multiple Tabs**: Same user in multiple tabs should share session
3. **Different Browsers**: Different browsers should have different sessions
4. **Incognito Mode**: Should create new session
5. **VPN/Proxy**: Should still maintain separate sessions

## Reporting Issues

If you find any data leakage or session mixing:

1. Note the exact steps to reproduce
2. Save browser console logs
3. Save backend server logs
4. Take screenshots of both users' screens
5. Check session IDs in both browsers

## Success Criteria

The system passes multi-client testing when:

- [ ] 5+ concurrent users can complete full conversations
- [ ] No data leakage between any users
- [ ] All verification codes remain isolated
- [ ] Results are calculated correctly for each user
- [ ] Sessions persist properly across refreshes
- [ ] WebSocket messages go only to intended recipients
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents spam without affecting normal use
