# Session ID Inconsistency Fix

## Problem
The frontend was receiving warnings about unexpected session ID changes:
```
⚠️ Session ID changed unexpectedly: 
{old: '1zevwRN17hqVba7mmsliynlajEUAjDhN', new: 'jyMaWeFQigd7Bb8SDXG56_eNLA3V5VFy'}
```

## Root Causes

1. **Inconsistent session ID access**: The backend was using both `req.session.id` and `req.sessionID`, which can return different values
2. **Premature session creation**: `saveUninitialized: true` was creating sessions before they were needed
3. **Session regeneration**: Express-session might regenerate IDs when transitioning from uninitialized to initialized state

## Solution

### 1. Standardized Session ID Access
Changed all occurrences to use `req.sessionID` consistently:
```typescript
// Before (inconsistent)
const sessionIdToUse = req.session.id || req.sessionID;

// After (consistent)
const sessionIdToUse = req.sessionID;
```

### 2. Lazy Session Initialization
Changed session configuration to only create sessions when needed:
```typescript
// Before
saveUninitialized: true,  // Creates session immediately

// After
saveUninitialized: false,  // Only creates session when data is stored
rolling: true,  // Resets cookie expiry on activity
```

### 3. Manual Session Initialization
Added explicit session initialization in the message handler:
```typescript
if (!req.session.initialized) {
  req.session.initialized = true;
  req.session.createdAt = Date.now();
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent session IDs**: No more unexpected changes
2. **Better performance**: Sessions only created when needed
3. **Improved security**: Less exposure of session IDs
4. **Activity-based expiry**: Sessions extend on user activity

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Clear browser storage and cookies
2. Start a new chat session
3. Monitor console for session ID logs
4. Verify no "Session ID changed unexpectedly" warnings appear

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing session fingerprinting for additional security
2. Add session rotation after authentication steps
3. Implement proper session cleanup on logout
4. Monitor for session anomalies in production
